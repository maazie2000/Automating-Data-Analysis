# MLBot


MLBot is a software application that can be used to simplify the processes of data analysis and machine learning. The software can parse a dataset of your choice and 
create a summarray report, visualize data in any graph and use machine learning to predict future data.



# 1) Uploading A Dataset

The software can input a csv(comma-separated values) file or a xlsx(excel) file. To upload a file, the dataset and software should be in a local directory. After your 
dataset is in the same directory as the software, you can now double click the software and you should see something similar to this:

If your File doesn't exist it will return a error. Once uploaded you can pick a choice by entering the number next to it and clicking enter.

# 2) Summary Report

You can select the summary report option by entering 1. This can summarize your data.

# 3) Visualize Data

You can select the visualize data option by entering 2. This can visualize your datain any graph you wish.

# 4) Predict Data

You can select the predict data option by entering 3. This can predict your data, given what you want to predict, and what feature do you want to use to predict.


# Updates

More instructions will be added to this README and the software soon.
